# dndmlpy
Processing pipelines and machine learning goofing around with Dungeons &amp; Dragons data

## Overview

A full write-up is pending, but this project would not have been possible without the excellent [dnddata](https://github.com/oganm/dnddata) project from oganm. To facilitate easy updating of that project's character list (which is used as a dataset in this project), I've added `dnddata` as a submodule to this project.
